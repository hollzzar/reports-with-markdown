# Creating HTML reports with R Markdown

This is an R Markdown tutorial developed for the [Language and Aging Lab](https://sites.psu.edu/mdiazlab/) at Penn State.

This document draws on my [R Markdown for Psychology Graduate Students](https://github.com/hollzzar/rmarkdown-guide) guide, as well as my [Cognitive Area Brownbag: R Markdown for Graduate Students](https://github.com/hollzzar/markdown-tutorial) tutorial.
